## üé® COLOR COORDINATION

### Image Selection Based on Color Scheme
**Primary Colors:** Navy (#0B2C3D), Yellow (#FFC72C), Paper White (#F5F5F5)

**Complementary Images:**
- **Navy Backgrounds:** Product images with dark/neutral backgrounds
- **Yellow Accents:** Yellow bike pattern matches accent color
- **Clean Contrast:** White/light backgrounds for text overlay

**Avoided:**
- Heavily saturated colors that clash with matte palette
- Busy backgrounds that compete with text
- Low contrast images that reduce readability

## üì± RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS

### Image Sizing Strategy
- **Hero Images:** Large landscape formats for desktop heroes
- **Product Cards:** Square/portrait formats for mobile-friendly cards
- **Lifestyle Images:** Mixed orientations for varied layouts
- **Brand Logos:** Vector formats where possible for scalability

### Mobile Optimization
- **Compressed Formats:** WebP used where supported
- **Fallback Images:** JPG/PNG for older browsers
- **Proper Aspect Ratios:** Optimized for mobile viewports
